## About the Project

This project is a fully responsive social media type site. We have a fixed navbar at the top, after that there is a home container which is a main show case area with a background image. This section containes the texts with icons and a form. After home section there are 3 sections (explore, create and share) that each of them a header and body section. Finally, there is a footer at the end of the page. 

## Techniques Used 

We add a navigation menu to the navigation bar using an unordered list of clickable list items with different "IDs". We use a button for the navigation menu so that the navigation menu is properly displayed on the small screen.

     :detail:   <button
          class="navbar-toggler"
          data-toggle="collapse"
          data-target="#navbarCollapse" >
          <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
        </button>
